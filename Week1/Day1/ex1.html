    <h1>Why I decided to learn to code</h1>
    <p>I first learned to code when I was <em>10 years</em> old and became <strong>passionate</strong> since then. 
        However, destiny took me to a different path and I followed a managerial/executive 
        career. Now, I have the opportunity to return and combine my experience with my 
        old passion.</p>
